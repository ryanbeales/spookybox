These are my rough notes so I remember what to do for Halloween 2023.

1. Get a raspberry pi and camera module
1. 3D print the freecad base model
1. Acquire a box, of the exact same dimensions... Like I said, these are my notes.
1. Git clone this in to /home/pi/src/
1. Run install.sh
1. Get spooky.
1. Open a browser on a mobile or desktop device to http://spookyboxpi.local:5000/static/index.html
